		<ul>
			<li>#10. Among Us
				<p>While I know Among Us has taken on a bit of a meme role in recent times,
				the game does have some merit to it. Among Us is a simple game of Mafia, but with a
				twist, instead of simply needing to find the Impostors, the Crewmates can also win
				by completing short minigames called "tasks". The Impostors, too, have a trick up
				their sleeve however. The Impostors are able to sabotage important functions such as
				lights or comms.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>#9. Minecraft
				<p>Minecraft has had a bit of a resurgence recently, and it's understandable why.
				Minecraft is a sandbox game with a large focus on exploration, and as I'm sure 
				you'll notice I mention a few times, is highly customizable with support for
				community-made mods.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>#8. Pokèmon Black
				<p>I will admit that this one is a bit of a nostalgia pick, but it's my list so let me 
				have this one. Pokèmon Black is part of the 5th Generation of the Pokèmon franchise, and 
				has what I consider to be the best story in the series' history. Though the main reason
				this is in my top ten is because Pokèmon Black is the first Pokèmon game I remember playing,
				and that firmly plants it in my mind as my favorite entry in the series.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>#7. Terraria
				<p>Terraria is another sandbox game, but while many compare it to Minecraft, the 
				two are actually very different games. Terraria is much more combat focused, with 
				hundreds of different weapons. Terraria also has a lot of bosses, some of which even tie in to 
				the game's unique progression system which changes the landscape as you play.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>#6. Team Fortress 2
				<p>Team Fortress 2 was the pioneer of the Hero Shooter genre. Releasing in 2007 Team Fortress 2 launched 
				with 9 unique classes, and stayed that way. Instead of simply adding more characters
				like many of its modern contemporaries, TF2 used its updates to make its 9 launch characters
				more complete. Each class has their own set of 3 default weapons, typically called "stock",
				Along with plenty of unlockable weapons that can completely change how a class plays.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>#5. The Binding of Isaac Repentance
				<p>The Binding of Isaac is a Roguelite game with heavy inspiration from The Legend of Zelda.
				The game has a huge amount of items, most of which have some sort of synergy with other items,
				as well as a large amount of enemies and room layouts. The game also has built-in mod support
				through the Steam workshop, allowing for even more content to be added at the player's discretion.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>#4. Super Mario Odyssey
				<p>Super Mario Odyssey is a collectathon 3D platformer developed by Nintendo and released on the Nintendo Switch in 2017.
				The game follows the general themes and playstyle of the Super Mario series with one key difference,
				a new mechanic called "capturing". Mario's hat this time around is actually a small hat-shaped ghost named Cappy,
				which allows Mario to throw his hat and then jump on it for extra height, or if thrown at an enemy, to possess them.
				The introduction of the capture mechanic changes up the gameplay of a 3D platformer and gives the game its own unique flavor.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>#3. Friday Night Funkin'
				<p>Friday Night Funkin' is the newest game on my list, and technically hasn't even released yet.
				However; the potential that this game has can not be ignored. Also the game has a huge modding scene
				allowing for new stories and songs to be added to the game. Modding here can be a bit clunky as 
				most mods download as their own seperate compiled game, but I personally think it's worth the hassle.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>#2. Undertale
				<p>What is there to say about Undertale that hasn't already been said? Undertale is an RPG that prides itself
				on a unique mechanic: sparing. Instead of fighting monsters, you can choose to act and help them, which allows you to 
				end an encounter without direct combat. I would say more, but I'd rather not spoil it, so if you haven't played it yet,
				I highly recommend it.
				</p>
