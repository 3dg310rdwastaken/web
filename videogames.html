		<ul>
			<li>#10. Among Us
				<p>While I know Among Us has taken on a bit of a meme role in recent times,
				the game does have some merit to it. Among Us is a simple game of Mafia, but with a
				twist, instead of simply needing to find the Impostors, the Crewmates can also win
				by completing short minigames called "tasks". The Impostors, too, have a trick up
				their sleeve however. The Impostors are able to sabotage important functions such as
				lights or comms.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>#9. Minecraft
				<p>Minecraft has had a bit of a resurgence recently, and it's understandable why.
				Minecraft is a sandbox game with a large focus on exploration, and as I'm sure 
				you'll notice I mention a few times, is highly customizable with support for
				community-made mods.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>#8. Pokèmon Black
				<p>I will admit that this one is a bit of a nostalgia pick, but it's my list so let me 
				have this one. Pokèmon Black is part of the 5th Generation of the Pokèmon franchise, and 
				has what I consider to be the best story in the series' history. Though the main reason
				this is in my top ten is because Pokèmon Black is the first Pokèmon game I remember playing,
				and that firmly plants it in my mind as my favorite entry in the series.</li>
