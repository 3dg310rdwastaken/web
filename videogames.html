		<ul>
			<li>#10. Among Us
				<p>While I know Among Us has taken on a bit of a meme role in recent times,
				the game does have some merit to it. Among Us is a simple game of Mafia, but with a
				twist, instead of simply needing to find the Impostors, the Crewmates can also win
				by completing short minigames called "tasks". The Impostors, too, have a trick up
				their sleeve however. The Impostors are able to sabotage important functions such as
				lights or comms.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>#9. Minecraft
				<p>Minecraft has had a bit of a resurgence recently, and it's understandable why.
				Minecraft is a sandbox game with a large focus on exploration, and as I'm sure 
				you'll notice I mention a few times, is highly customizable with support for
				community-made mods.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>#8. Pokèmon Black
				<p>I will admit that this one is a bit of a nostalgia pick, but it's my list so let me 
				have this one. Pokèmon Black is part of the 5th Generation of the Pokèmon franchise, and 
				has what I consider to be the best story in the series' history. Though the main reason
				this is in my top ten is because Pokèmon Black is the first Pokèmon game I remember playing,
				and that firmly plants it in my mind as my favorite entry in the series.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>#7. Terraria
				<p>Terraria is another sandbox game, but while many compare it to Minecraft, the 
				two are actually very different games. Terraria is much more combat focused, with 
				hundreds of different weapons. Terraria also has a lot of bosses, some of which even tie in to 
				the game's unique progression system which changes the landscape as you play.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>#6. Team Fortress 2
				<p>Team Fortress 2 was the pioneer of the Hero Shooter genre. Releasing in 2007 Team Fortress 2 launched 
				with 9 unique classes, and stayed that way. Instead of simply adding more characters
				like many of its modern contemporaries, TF2 used its updates to make its 9 launch characters
				more complete. Each class has their own set of 3 default weapons, typically called "stock",
				Along with plenty of unlockable weapons that can completely change how a class plays.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>#5. The Binding of Isaac Repentance
				<p>The Binding of Isaac is a Roguelite game with heavy inspiration from The Legend of Zelda.
				The game has a huge amount of items, most of which have some sort of synergy with other items,
				as well as a large amount of enemies and room layouts. The game also has built-in mod support
				through the Steam workshop, allowing for even more content to be added at the player's discretion.
