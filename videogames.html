			<li>#10. Among Us
				<p>While I know Among Us has taken on a bit of a meme role in recent times,
				the game does have some merit to it. Among Us is a simple game of Mafia, but with a
				twist, instead of simply needing to find the Impostors, the Crewmates can also win
				by completing short minigames called "tasks". The Impostors, too, have a trick up
				their sleeve however. The Impostors are able to sabotage important functions such as
				lights or comms.</p></li>
