		<h2>About</h2> 
			
			<p>I was born in <strong>Northwest Ohio</strong> in November of 2004.
			   When I was very young my mom was charged with a drug based crime, and I was put in foster care.
			   After a few years my grandma obtained custody and I was back in my home town of Defiance.
			   My grandma passed away of a heart attack when I was in sixth grade, 
			   and because she had custody over me at the time, I was put into foster care again.
			   After a year, my mom finally regained custody and I came back to live with her.
			   Not long after, we moved to Napoleon, where I currently live.
			   I am currently enrolled at Four County Career Center in 
			   <a href="https://mrgeiger.com/" title="Mr. Geiger's">Mr. Geiger's</a>
			   computer programming lab.</p>
